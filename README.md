- scikit-learn

These can all be installed through pip: `pip install jupyterlab numpy matplotlib energyflow scikit-learn`. It is recommended to do this in a virtual environment or Conda environment. To set up a virtual environment, you can do the following:
```
python3 -m venv bdt_omnifold_venv
source bdt_omnifold_venv/bin/activate
pip install -U pip
pip install jupyterlab numpy matplotlib energyflow scikit-learn
```
